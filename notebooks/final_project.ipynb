You will work be graded in groups of 2, but you are welcome to collaborate with others. \n",

    "\n",
    "The pyloric network of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) is a well-studied component of the crustacean nervous system that provides valuable insights into neural circuit function. Computational models of the pyloric network have been instrumental in understanding how neural circuits maintain functional stability despite biological variability and perturbations. It consists of about 14 neurons that generate a rhythmic motor pattern controlling the pylorus of the crustacean stomach that are connected by a set of Cholinergic and Glutamatergic synapses.\n",

    "- Anterior Burster (AB) neuron\n",
    "- Pyloric Dilator (PD) neurons\n",
    "- Lateral Pyloric (LP) neuron\n",
    "- Pyloric (PY) neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplified model that we will be using in the following approximates all neurons of the same type with a single compartmental model and also treats the electrically coupled AB and PD neurons as a single neuron. This leads to the following circuit:\n",
